# RDF::EDTF

This is an `RDF::Literal` implementation around [Extended Date Time
Format][EDTF].

The underlying EDTF parser and implementation is provided by
[`edtf-ruby`][edtf-ruby]. ~~The parser supports all EDTF features, with caveats
noted below.~~ EDTF has been updated (2019) since the original publishing of
this library, and not all features currently use the new syntax. More complete
documentation about what is supported (and what isnâ€™t) TBD.

## Usage

```ruby
require 'rdf/edtf'

RDF::EDTF::Literal.new('1076?')
# or
RDF::Literal('1076?', datatype: RDF::EDTF::Literal::DATATYPE)
```
